# Overview and General Information


## Network Names

From now on the UOM/AGOS surface seismic array has been given the Network code UM (Univiersity of Melbourne)

The UOM/AGOS borehole array has been given the network code BM (borehole melbourne).


These network codes were selected since neither are currently registered IRIS Codes, leaving us open to send our data through to IRIS at some stage in the future, if indeed we decide to go down that path.
